# ðŸ§  Name Recall Challenge & Social Memory Simulator

This Unity project simulates memory training tasks for facial-name association and recall, designed to help evaluate short-term memory and cognitive processing related to social interactions.

## ðŸŽ® Overview

Players are shown a sequence of faces, each paired with a name (with optional audio playback). After an encoding phase, they complete a brief distractor task before being asked to recall the names associated with each face.

The recall phase supports two modes:
- **Multiple Choice** (with randomized distractor names)
- **Typed Input** (user types in the remembered name)

Each recall response is measured for:
- **Accuracy**
- **Response Time**
- **System-generated Confidence Rating**

## ðŸ—‚ Project Structure

- `Scripts/` â€“ Contains core game logic (`GameController.cs`, etc.)
- `Prefabs/` â€“ Includes UI components for face cards, buttons, etc.
- `Resources/Sprites/Faces/` â€“ Realistic face images used during sessions
- `Resources/Audio/Names/` â€“ Optional audio clips for name playback
- `Scenes/` â€“ Main game scene

## ðŸ”§ How to Use

1. **Clone the repo** (private â€” only invited collaborators can access):

2. **Open in Unity** (recommended: Unity 2021.3+)

3. **Play** the scene in the Unity Editor or build as a standalone app.

## ðŸ§  Future Plans

- EEG integration (LSL or serial interface) for real-time brain marker recording
- Session data export (CSV or JSON)
- User profiles and long-term progress tracking
- Additional distractor tasks and memory modalities (sound, words, etc.)
